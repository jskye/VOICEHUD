# voicehud

VoiceHud was my final thesis project for software engineering.
It is a framework for voice commanded HUD GUI interfaces.
It demonstrates this on a simple DrivingSimulation that plays a video and overlays the HUD when voice commands are recognised using Sphinx4.
The simulation is decoupled such that it can be swapped out for a custom simulation for some other domain.
tbc.
