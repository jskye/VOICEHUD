VoiceHud was my final thesis project for software engineering.
It is a framework for voice commanded HUD GUI interfaces.
It demonstrates this on a simple DrivingSimulation that plays a video and overlays the HUD when voice commands are recognised using Sphinx4. It also uses FreeTTS to readback to the user.
The simulation is decoupled such that it can be swapped out for a custom simulation for some other domain.
